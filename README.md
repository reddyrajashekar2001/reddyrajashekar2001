👋 Hi, I'm @reddyrajashekar2001, and welcome to my GitHub profile!

👀 I have a keen interest in various programming languages and technologies.

🌱 Currently, I'm dedicated to expanding my knowledge and skills. I'm actively learning ReactJS, Java, Python, SQL, HTML, and CSS to become a well-rounded developer.

💞️ I'm open to collaboration on exciting projects that involve any of the technologies I'm learning. If you have a project idea or want to work together, feel free to reach out.

📫 You can contact me through GitHub, and I'm always open to connect with fellow developers and enthusiasts in the programming world. Let's learn and grow together!
